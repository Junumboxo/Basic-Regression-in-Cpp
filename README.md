# Regression in C++

This is the repository for my Basics of Programming 2 Final project - Basic regression models in C++
The goal is to implement the most common regression algorithms from scratch using the gradient decsent algorithm for optimization.

Currently implemented:
1. Linear regression
2. Polynomial (of the 2nd order) regression
3. Logistic regression

Visualization tool used - https://github.com/sciplot/sciplot/
