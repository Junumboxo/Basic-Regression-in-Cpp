# Regression in C++

*The project is being currently developed*

This is the repository for my Basics of Programming 2 Final project - Basic regression models in C++


The 2 main goals are:
1. To make use of the most important OOP principle.
2. To implement the most common regression algorithms from scratch using the gradient decsent algorithm for optimization.

Currently implemented:
1. Linear regression
2. Polynomial (of the 2nd order) regression
3. Logistic regression
